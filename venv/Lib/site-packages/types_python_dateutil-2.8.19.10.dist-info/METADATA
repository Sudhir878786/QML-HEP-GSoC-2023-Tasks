## Typing stubs for python-dateutil

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `python-dateutil` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`python-dateutil`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/python-dateutil. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `45f0a5e7e47a23d6be67cfce429c4f2c0de62a29`.
